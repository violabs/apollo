# Getting Started

# Overview

This is a public application for connection to Neo4J. Also comes with some publicly available seed data.

# Requirements

In order to run this application you need to install Neo4j (Neo4j Desktop recommended) and either
setup the password the same as the `application-local.yml` & `application-test.yml` or change the property files for
each to match your password. Same with the database names - current are:

* LOCAL: `thewell`
* TEST: `theabyss`

Nonprod and Prod is not included as a `yml` for security reasons - if you see either profiles know that you will
have to provide your own to access the code.
